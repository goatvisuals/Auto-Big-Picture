The tool should work on most distros from the **Arch, Debian/Ubuntu, and Fedora families**. It should also play nice with derivatives like CachyOS, Mint, Nobara etc. If your distro works *(or doesn't)* let me know so I can look into it


**Setups I always test on:**

* âœ… Arch + KDE Plasma (Wayland)
* âœ… CachyOS + Hyprland (Wayland)
* âœ… Ubuntu + Gnome (Wayland)
* âœ… Mint + Cinnamon (X11)
* âœ… Fedora + KDE Plasma (Wayland)

## Supported Controllers

Tested with **Xbox Wireless Controller** both via bluetooth and USB, but should work with any controller

## Installation

<details>

<summary>Arch based</summary>

<br>

Use your fav AUR helper

```bash
yay -S auto-big-picture
```

and run ``auto-big-picture-setup`` to go through setup

<br>

> **Note:** After updates you will need to run ``auto-big-picture-setup`` again to apply the update.

<br>

</details>

<details>

<summary>Debian based</summary>

<br>

Download the latest .deb file from the [releases page](https://github.com/goatvisuals/Auto-Big-Picture/releases)

Double click the file or install with:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i auto-big-picture_X.X-X_all.deb # Replace X's to match most up to date version
```

auto-big-picture-setup
```

<br>

</details>

<details>

<summary>Everyone else</summary>

<br>

Just clone the repo and run the installer script. It will guide you through the rest.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/goatvisuals/auto-big-picture.git
cd auto-big-picture
./install.sh
```
The script will handle dependencies if needed (bluez/bluez-utils for Bluetooth mode)

<br>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Manual uninstall</summary>

<br>

If you prefer to manually uninstall, you can do it by stopping and disabling the service and then removing the files. The service file is always located at `~/.config/systemd/user/auto-big-picture.service`, and the config/script is by default stored in `~/.config/auto-big-picture/auto-big-picture.py` (or a different location you chose during installation).


**1 Stop and disable the service:**
```bash
systemctl --user stop auto-big-picture.service
systemctl --user disable auto-big-picture.service
```

**2 Reload systemd:**
```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
```

**3 Remove the files (change last 2 paths if you chose a custom config dir):**
```bash
rm -f ~/.config/systemd/user/auto-big-picture.service
rm -f ~/.config/auto-big-picture/auto-big-picture.py
rmdir ~/.config/auto-big-picture
```

## For the nerds (how does it work?)

It's a python script that uses bluetoothctl polling to check bluetooth status and periodically checks `/dev/input` for USB devices. The game check just looks for processes running from your `steamapps/common` directory to avoid closing when in game (for example if batteries die or controller goes to sleep because of inactivity)
